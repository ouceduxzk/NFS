BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
build with Eclipse:
	in Eclipse do File->Import->Project->FromGit
	should build without errors

dependencies:
	OncRpc
	ArgParse4j.1.6.0

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
----------------
from the project directory:
- use this to start the Watcher, watching a directory called test into ten servers at ip-address 192.168.56.101, with mount points /exports/s0 to /exports/s9. This will use Shamir's Secret Sharing; a prime number will be stored to a file called PRIME. 
	
$ java -classpath bin:lib/oncrpc.jar:lib/argparse4j-0.6.0.jar watcher.Watcher $(for i in $(seq 0 9); do echo -s 192.168.56.101:/exports/s$i; done) -l test -u 1000 -g 1000 -n $(whoami)

	-use this to restore a file with the Helper, reconstructing it from 3 randomly chosen servers at ip-address 192.168.56.101 with mount points /exports/s0 to /exports/s0. This will use Shamir's secret sharing and load the prime number stored in the file called PRIME. Note: The path to which the FILE will be stored must start with a '/'.
	$ java -classpath bin:lib/oncrpc.jar:lib/argparse4j-0.6.0.jar watcher.NFSHelper $(for i in $(seq 0 9 | shuf | head -n3); do echo -s $i:192.168.56.101:/exports/s$i; done) -l restore -u 1000 -g 1000 -n $(whoami) /FILE

SERVER SETUP
============

To simulate multiple servers, we can export multiple mount points from a single physical server. Note: We do not know how to do this on OSX, on linux input the following commands into the terminal and set /etc/exports to the following

$ sudo mkdir /exports
$ sudo mkdir /exports/s{0..9}
$ ip addr ### change ipaddr accordingly
$ vim /etc/exports >(put this in file)>

		/exports     192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s0  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s1  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s2  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s3  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s4  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s5  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s6  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s7  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s8  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		/exports/s9  192.168.56.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
		$ sudo apt-get install tree
		$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common nfs-kernel-server	
		$ cat /etc/exports
		$ showmount -e
		$ cd /tmp && mkdir nfs-mount && sudo mount 192.168.56.101:/exports/s0 nfs-mount && sudo touch "/exports/s0/abc.$(date)" && tree nfs-mount
		$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /exports && sudo chmod -R ugo+rwX /exports
		$ ls -1al /exports/*  ### have to all be owned by user

SHAMIR'S SECRET SHARING
=======================
For Shamir Secret Sharing, you need to split a single data item into multiple pieces, and give one piece each to multiple recipients. 

In this case, you take a single file, encrypt it with an AES key, then split that AES key into >3 parts. You give of the encrypted file and one piece of the AES key to multiple servers.

Each server has one piece of the key and a copy of the encrypted file. All copies of the encrypted file are identical. Each piece of the key is different. You need 3 pieces of the key to reconstruct the original whole AES key, and you cannot decrypt any of the copies of the file without the intact, whole AES key. You can simulate multiple NFS servers by having one physical computer export multiple NFS mount points.

From the perspective of the Watcher or the Helper, there is no difference if you have multiple NFSClients connected to [192.168.1.100:/exports, 192.168.1.101:/exports, 192.168.1.102:/exports, 192.168.1.103:/exports, 192.168.1.104:/exports] or to [192.168.1.100:/exports0, 192.168.1.100:/exports1, 192.168.1.100:/exports2, 192.168.1.100:/exports3, 192.168.1.100:/exports4]
In the former case, you have four physical servers connected to the network with four unique IP addresses, each exporting the /exports path.

In the latter case, you have one physical server connected to the network with one unique IP address, exporting five /exports{0..4} paths. When you backup a file using SSS with the latter setup, you AES encrypt the file to create AES(file). You send AES(file) to each NFS mount and end up with five copies of the exact same data in each of the /exports{0..4} directories.

You take the key and use SSS to split it into {key0, key1, ..., key4} and send these to each NFS mount. You end up with key0 stored in /exports0, key1 stored in /exports1, ..., key4 stored in /exports4.

TESTING
=======
Watcher, Client, and Helper were tested in SSS-mode as following:
	1. $ cd NFS

	2. $ mkdir test restore

	3. $ java -classpath bin:lib/oncrpc.jar:lib/argparse4j-0.6.0.jar watcher.Watcher $(for i in $(seq 0 9); do echo -s 192.168.56.101:/exports/s$i; done) -l test -u 1000 -g 1000 -n $(whoami)

	4. ### simple test
    	$ gshuf /usr/share/dict/words | head -n 100 > words

	5. ### large file test
	    $ gshuf /usr/share/dict/words | head -n 10000 > words.2

	6. ### multi file test
	    $ for i in $(gseq 1 100); do gshuf /usr/share/dict/words | head -n 10000 > words.multi.$i; done

	7. ### directory test
	    $ mkdir -p a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p
	    $ for i in $(gseq 1 100); do gshuf /usr/share/dict/words | head -n 10000 > a/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p/words.$i; done
